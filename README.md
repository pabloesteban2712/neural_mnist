## Neural Network for Number Detection

This project uses Python and TensorFlow to create a neural network that can detect numbers in images. The model is trained on a dataset of handwritten digits, and it can predict the number in a given image.

## Requirements
Before running the project, you need to install the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)

## Dataset
The model is trained using the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits (0-9). The dataset is already available in TensorFlow, so you don't need to download it manually.

## Model Architecture
The neural network architecture used in this project is a simple feedforward network with one hidden layer. 
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss function.
